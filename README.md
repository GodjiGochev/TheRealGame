Rock, Papers, Scissors is a little funny game for two or more people, but in our case in java it just me and my computer.
In this mini project of mine I created this game whit very simple code, first I created my three methods for my "rock and papers and scissors"
Then I created my input String so I can call my move, then I created the computer random move so I can have someone to play with.
Then it was time to create some sstatements for the computer moves to assign his moves, and then I created statement for the final result of the game.
And finale I did not forget about the draw, because is I play "rock" and the computer plays "rock" it will be draw.
And thats it, simple little funny game, here is a little preview of the game itself:
